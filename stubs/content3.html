			Good breakfast spot for out of town group of 4. Was within walking
			distance of hotels in Tribeca. Arrived at 9 am on a Sunday and just
			beat the breakfast rush. Servers were attentive and menu had a variety
			of breakfast selections. Decor and ambience was bright and airy.
			Staff seemed to handle families with young children well. Finally,
			you must respect an establishment that has a dessert menu for
			breakfast/brunch. Prices were as you should expect in NY, but
			not outrageous.
